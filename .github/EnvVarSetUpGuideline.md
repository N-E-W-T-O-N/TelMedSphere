# Environment Variables Setup Guidelines

This document provides a step-by-step guide to setting up the required `.env` files for both the frontend and backend. These variables are essential for the application to function properly.

## **Backend `.env` Variables**

1. **`DBURL (Mongo URL)`**  
   - **Description:** The MongoDB connection string.  
   - **How to Obtain:** 
     1. Go to MongoDB Atlas and sign up or log in. 
     2. Create a new cluster if you don't have one already. 
     3. Navigate to Database Access and create a new database user with the appropriate permissions (e.g., readWrite). 
     4. In the Network Access tab, allow connections from your IP address (or use 0.0.0.0/0 for all IPs for testing). 
     5. Go to Clusters, click on Connect, and select Connect your application. 
     6. Copy the connection string provided (it should look like `mongodb+srv://<username>: <password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority`). 
     7. Replace <username> and <password> with the credentials you created in step 3. 
     8. Set the DBURL variable in your env file with the full MongoDB Atlas URL. 
     
     For a local MongoDB setup, you can install MongoDB locally and use 
     `mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name`

2. **`HOST_EMAIL (NodeMailer)`**

     3. Generate a new password and copy it. 
     4. Set HOST_EMAIL to your email address (e.g., youremail@gmail.com) and PASSWORD to the generated app password.

     ```
     HOST_EMAIL=youremail@gmail.com 
     PASSWORD=your_app_password

### **Important Notes**
- Always keep `.env` files private and do not expose them in version control systems like GitHub.  
- Use environment variable management tools like `dotenv` in development or configure the deployment environment with these variables.  
- Ensure secure storage and limited access to keys, passwords, and tokens.
